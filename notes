Go to: https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/

For my installation, i already had node installed, but i needed watchman.

I had to install homebrew from here: https://docs.brew.sh/Installation

Then i updated homebrew and upgraded it.

Then i installed watchman with instructions from here: 
https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install#buildinstall

Then i downloaded android studio manually following this exp tutorial: 
https://docs.expo.io/workflow/android-studio-emulator/

Then  i followed this tutorial to connect my app to android studio: 
https://medium.com/@samailabalap/setting-up-react-native-with-expo-and-android-studio-on-ubuntu-18-04-84340bc2cc3c

Now that i have android studio installed and ready and all the exp requirements ready.

I installed expo-cli via react native here: https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup

    Choose either yarn or npm and then. For this build we are using yarn. 
    In your terminal write:
    -->  yarn global add expo-cli 

Download the folder template (similar to create-react-app but for react native)

    ==> expo init signal-clone-yt

In the termianl you will be given a bunch of options. 

    Press enter on --> blank a minimal app as clean as an empty canvas

Cd into the folder and in the vsc termianl write:

    --> yarn start
